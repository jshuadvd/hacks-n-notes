# AMQP

> Advanced Message Queuing Protocol

- Used for message oriented middleware
- Composed of queuing, routing, **publish-and-subscribe**.
- Vendor agnostic like FTP, HTTP, etc.
- Data sent across the network as a stream of octets (8 bits) hence it is binary.
- language agnostic


Mounted on top of a reliable transport layer protocol such as Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).
