# Information Theory

- Pictogram: a drawing that resembles the physical object that it represents, eg. a happy face or a human 
- Ideogram: a conceptual picture of an abstract idea, like the symbol of peace
- Rebus theory: sound + sound = new meaning
- Proto language: instead of letters using icons
- Symbol rate: the speed at which you can send a symbol on and off.. eg. a bitrate

## Morse code
- bits and dashes to compose letters
- send through electric impulses
- uses the binary combinations like the flag system
- the most used letters were the easier to type
