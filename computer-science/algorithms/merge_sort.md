# Merge Sort

> One of the fastest sorting algorithms. Used by general computing and machine learning.

### Performance

Θ$$(nlgn)$$

## Pseudo-code

Recursive algorithm composed of two stages:

1. Split the array into halves. Θ(1) 
2. Merge the units in a sorted way. Θ$$(n)$$

The recursive part brings the $$lgn$$ since the splitting creates a *binary tree* data structure which reduces by a power of two each increase of $$n$$.


## Example code

```javascript
