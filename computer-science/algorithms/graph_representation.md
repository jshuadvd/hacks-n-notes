# Graph representation

> Graphs are connections between entities.

- The social network is a graph.

## Glossary

term | definition
-- | --
acyclic graph | a path with no cycles
adjacent or incident | when two vertices are connected
cycle | a path that reconnects with the origin vertex
dag | an *acyclic graph*
degree | the amount of edges between two vertices
edge | a line representing the connection between two vertices
directed graph | a graph which edges have one direction flow
in-degree | the number of edges pointing into a vertex
out-degree | the number of edges pointing out of a vertex
neighbors | a vertex refering to another adjacent vertex
path | the sequential edges that connect two vertices
shortest path | the path with less edges
sparse graph | graph with relatively few edges
to leave | when a directed edge points out of a vertex
to enter | when a directed edge points into a vertex
undirected graph | a graph which edges go both ways
vertex | a single entity
vertices | entities in the graph

## Weighted graph

> The edges can have a numeric weight.

For example, a weight can be the distance between two cities (*vertices*).

## Use cases

- Social networks
- road maps
- flowcharts
- dependency flow charts

## Representation

![Khan academy](social_network_num.png)

- *vertices* are mostly names as numbers.
- |V| means all *vertices* from 0 to V - 1


### Criteria
1. How much memory or space we need in each representation
2. How long will it take to determine whether a given *edge* is in the graph
3. How long it takes to find the *neighbors* of a given *vertex*

### Types

#### 1. Edge list

> An *edge list* is an array of *|E|* edges.

- an edge can be an object or a sub-array
- you can add the weight there

##### Example
```javascript
const graph = [ [0,1], [0,6], [0,8], [1,4], [1,6], [1,9], [2,4], [2,6], [3,4], [3,5],
[3,8], [4,5], [4,9], [7,8], [7,9] ]
```

##### Evaluation
- A search would be more of a linear search unless optimized 

#### 2. Adjacency matrices

> A matrix of |V| x |V| 

- Symmetric matrix if it is an *undirected graph*

![Khan Academy](adjacency_matrix.png)

- The matrix can be represented as an array of rows (sub-arrays)
- The intersections state if there is an edge between x and y

```javascript
const graph = 
[ [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0],
  [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0],
  [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1],
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1],
  [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
  [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0] ]
  ```
  
##### Pros
  
  - Search in constant time eg. `graph[1][2]`  
  
##### Cons
  
  - Takes Î˜($$V^2$$) space
  - To determine which *vertices* are *adjacent* to a *vertex* **x** it takes a linear search through all the **x** row

#### 3. Adjacency lists
