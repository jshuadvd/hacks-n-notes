# Networks

## Bit transfer

- 1 bit is a boolean
- 1 byte = 8 bits

### Bandwidth

## DNS (Domain Name Server)

### Domain name mapping

- `A` record maps a domain name directly to an IP address (preferred)
- `CNAME` record maps one domain name to another and are less flexible.

- domain mapping is usually aggressively cached (can take up to 48 hours to update)
- if you want to show the change immediately, redirect the current server to the Coming soon while you wait for the DNS to update the cache.
