> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_innovation

- designers at companies work 9-5 boring jobs. They don't deliver their best when they find themselved discouraged

## Selling your idea
- show them how your idea can make them grow.
- first to market wins (get first into shelf-space)
- consumers are driven more by desire. Easier to target than B2B


## Pros of licensing ideas
- reduces R&D costs
- accelerates product development
- multiplies the ideators

# One Simple Idea (Book)

## Manufacturing vs Licensing

- `Simple idea + existing technology + 3 or 4 players in the market = LICENSING`
- `Unique idea + new technology + 1 or 2 major players in the market = MANUFACTURING`

## how to bring an idea to market by yourself

### Study the market
- who are your customers
- who are your competitors
- what can you offer that is different

### Develop your product
- Design product and packaging
- Build and test prototypes
- File a patent
- How to manufacture the product
- Regulations and requirements
- Business plan (production, distribution, manufacturing)
- Raise capital
- Licenses, insurance, employees...
- Sell


## how to bring an idea to market by licensing

### Study the market
- competitors (major and small players)
- how does my idea compares and contrasts
- value proposition
- how large is the market
- primary customers
- potential sales

### Develop your product
> Prove that it is sellable, doable and valuable

- file a provisional patent

## Ideas
> Create an idea for what is missing and needed in an existing market

- look for categories that you're passionate about

### Brainstorming
- don't judge ideas in brainstorming mode

#### Mix and match
> pick two different objects and think how to combine them

- eg. camera + phone
- water toy + jet technology = Super Soaker

#### What if
> ask what if a product could do X

- eg. Netflix (what if there were no late rental fees?)

#### Solve it
> observe problems in day-to-day and try to solve it

- eg. Spinformation
- your problems might not be a problem for everyone

### Choose your winning idea

Assess which idea to work with:
- focus on one idea at a time, all the way through the entire development and licensing process before picking another idea
- doesn't matter how big/small, complex/simple, unique or clever it is
- focus on ideas that will take the least amount of work and the highest possibilities of success.
- ideas should be able to be explained in a sentence. Avoid ideas that require education of the customer since that is very expensive

### Litmus test

#### does it solves a common problem?
- confirmed and well defined needs instead of maybes
- the most universal the better

#### does it has a wow factor?
- wow consumers and potential licensees

#### has a large market?
- a product that can be sold by all the major retailers for that market
- it almost takes the same amount of time and effort to license a product with a big market than it is for a moderate market.
- find if the category is a growth category
- are the comparable products selling well?
- how are similar products priced?
- what is selling, who is buying? who are the major players?
- which are the trends?

#### uses common production methods and materials?
- how will it be manufactured
- how much will it cost to manufacture?
- get a network of experts, mentors in that category. someone who has already done it

#### Challenging industries
- software
- packaging

#### Recommended industries
- pet
- kitchen/household
- hardware
- novelty gift
- direct response TV


### Most marketable ideas are:
- evolutionary, incremental improvements to existing products
- solve problems
- address needs
- satisfy desires

> which means customers are willing to pay for them

- look for small changes that make a big impact


### Generate ideas
- audio recording, notepads, sketches
- dump all product ideas into a repository
- use Evernote
- serendipity might happen in the shower, while driving, on an airplane, etc. So be ready to take those notes.
- look at things with creativity and wonder like you did when you were a child
- passion drives creativity
- look at things in different ways and angles

### Awake sleeping dinosaurs

- find products that have been unchanged for a long time and make a simple change.
- eg. laser tag, denim bags, alien guitar pick

### Inventors logbook
