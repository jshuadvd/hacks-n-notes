# Internet Marketing

## Analytics

- [Segmentio](https://segment.com/) - triage user events with tons of integrations like mixpanel, google analytics, zendesk, salesforce, etc.

## Youtube

### Consistent branding
- use a logo. always the same
- catchphrase. like a slogan that you say in every video eg. "This is Ants in AntsAndAlex.com, if you want to see more videos go to my youtube channel"
- have a 3 seconds intro. Youtubers want things to be very quick
