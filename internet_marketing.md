# Internet Marketing

## Youtube

### Consistent branding
- use a logo. always the same
- catchphrase. like a slogan that you say in every video eg. "This is Ants in AntsAndAlex.com, if you want to see more videos go to my youtube channel"
- have a 3 seconds intro. Youtubers want things to be very quick
