# Ethereum

> Beyond financial applications, any environments where trust, security, and permanence are important – for instance, asset-registries, voting, governance, and the internet of things – could be massively impacted by the Ethereum platform.

## Types of accounts

There are two types of accounts which share the same address space:

- **Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs)**, which are controlled by private keys by humans
- **Contract Accounts**, which are controlled by their contract code and can only be “activated” by an EOA


## Smart contracts

- “smart contracts” refers to code in a Contract Account – programs that execute when a transaction is sent to that account. Users can create new contracts by deploying code to the blockchain.

## Transactions

Like in Bitcoin, users must pay small transaction fees to the network. This protects the Ethereum blockchain from frivolous or malicious computational tasks, like DDoS attacks or infinite loops. The sender of a transaction must pay for each step of the “program” they activated, including computation and memory storage. These fees are paid in amounts of Ethereum’s native value-token, **ether**.

## Mining

Bitcoin mining model encourages specialized equipment to solve the blockchain. Ethereum changed the model to a memory-hard computational problem so the general computer is the ideal machine to solve ethereums blocks. That way it guarantees the evenly distributed descentralization, instead of having a few mega miners.
