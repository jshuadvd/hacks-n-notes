# Ethereum

> Beyond financial applications, any environments where trust, security, and permanence are important – for instance, asset-registries, voting, governance, and the internet of things – could be massively impacted by the Ethereum platform.

## Projects

## Types of accounts

There are two types of accounts:

- **Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs)**, which are controlled by private keys by humans
- **Contract Accounts**, which are controlled by their contract code and can only be “activated” by an EOA

## Smart contracts

- “smart contracts” refers to code in a Contract Account – programs that execute when a transaction is sent to that account. Users can create new contracts by deploying code to the blockchain.
