## How to create a Egghead screencast

### Self-contained and focus
- No intros/outros in the video. Put them in the course description as text.
- focus on the code. the bulk of the lesson should be typing.
- avoid long notes
- do first, explain after typing
- explaining "why" should be on the course description text, and not in the video
- avoid *brittle* information, which can become outdated quickly, eg. "this feature is not supported by all browsers"
- avoid referencing an external resource eg. another lesson
- stay modular

### Audio
- microphone audio level should be as close to the red as possible

### Lesson resources

- Title, description and code snippets
- title compose it by {How do I} ... without putting the "How do I"

### Screen
- resolution 1280 x 720 HiDPI
