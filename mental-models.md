> Mental Models are concepts, frameworks or worldviews that help you interpret and understand the relationships and patterns.

10 Reps per Day

About to-do lists

> Creating a to-do list from most important to least important and then kicking butt right on down the list. Dalio calls this layer of reality the blizzard because lots of things are constantly coming at you from different directions, and it’s hard to get clarity on what really matters.

About skill plateau

> most people learn quickly in new situations, but soon plateau after they’re “good enough” and never get better with more experience. This has been heavily studied in the professional world, and it’s evident in our daily lives. Has driving more made you a better driver? Has typing more made you a better typist?

About placing bets for the future

> ‘What’s NOT going to change in the next 10 years?’  
> You can build a business strategy around the things that are stable in time. Like predicting that people will always want lower costs and faster deliveries \(Amazon\).  Focus on what’s guaranteed to be valuable rather than speculating. The energy we put into it today will still be paying off dividends for our customers 10 years from now.
