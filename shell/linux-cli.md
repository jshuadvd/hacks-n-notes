# Linux CLI

## Prompt

The CLI Prompt structure is composed as `USERNAME@SERVER:DIRECTORY$`

eg. `jorge@localhost:~$`

The `~` stands for the user's home directory.

The `$` shows that the current user is a **normal user**

The `#` shows that the user is a **root user** (administrator)

## Important Directories & files

- `home/` Where the user directories are.
- `/var/log/` Where the system logs are.
- `/var/log/dmesg/` The boot log.

## Filesystem Hierarchy Standard

Describes locations, permissions, filenames.
