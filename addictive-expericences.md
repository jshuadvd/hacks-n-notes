# Addictive Experience

> There are some features or way of doing things that trigger addiction in users.

## Experiences

###  Seeming to have multiple choices

- Menus, catalogs, lists, etc. are examples of apparent choices.
- In reality someone or an algorithm limited the user to those specific options.

### Slot machine behavior

- Red notification counters, number of likes, etc, are like slots machines that create addiction 
- The addiction is created by variable reward. The result always changes.
- This is why we constantly go back to check the statuses of the apps.

### Fear of Missing Something Important (FOMSI)

- inducing a “1% chance you could be missing something important.
- not being able to unsubscribe from newsletters, groups, unfriend people, etc.

### Social Approval

> We’re all vulnerable to social approval. The need to belong, to be approved or appreciated by our peers is among the highest human motivations.

- when you get tagged in a picture by a friend who was incentivized by the app

### Social reciprocity

- follow me and I follow back
- receive a message, respond a message
- add in linkedin, add back
