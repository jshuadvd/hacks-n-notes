# Addictive Experience

> There are some features or way of doing things that trigger addiction in users.

## Experiences

###  Seeming to have multiple choices

- Menus, catalogs, lists, etc. are examples of apparent choices.
- In reality someone or an algorithm limited the user to those specific options.

### Slot machine behavior

- Red notification counters, number of likes, etc, are like slots machines that create addiction 
- The addiction is created by variable reward. The result always changes.
- This is why we constantly go back to check the statuses of the apps.

### Fear of Missing Something Important (FOMSI)
