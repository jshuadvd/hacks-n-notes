## Scales

Scales have a type, a range and a domain

s_cales are functions that map from an input domain to an output range._

the default type is a linear scale \(the relationship between the value in the data object and the actual position of the mark is of the form: y = ax + b \),

the domain is defined by the smallest and highest values for found in the dataset

the range is the total width of the XYPlot minus the margin.
