# Stock Options

With stocks an trader can use the leverage of stock options. 

## Call Option

Call Option is a right to purchase a stock at a certain price within a certain price. 

If a trader thinks the market is going up, the trader may use a call option.

eg. if stock is worth $10 today, and the trader senses that the stock will go up in value, the trader may buy the call option for $1. If the trader is correct, and the stock goes to $20, the trader has made $10 with $1. If the trader thinks the market is going down, the trader may use a PUT option, or short the stock.

In Real Estate, the Call option would be the down payment. Because it freezes the payment of the property for the time of the loan.

## Questions

- Why my Purchased Stock Options were the same value as the real stock price when I bought it? Shouldn't it be cheaper since it's just an option?
- Can I set the price on my stock options?
- Are Stock Options transferable?
