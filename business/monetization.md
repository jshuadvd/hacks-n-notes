# Monetization

## Recurring crowd-sourcing scheme

- Charge each month until the server expenses and a loyalty fee is covered for the developer/owner. 
- Have transparent finance reports on how the website is doing and how much it is needed to cover the maintenance. (Progres bar)
- So it will be a crowd charge.. sort of a recurring kickstarter. 
- Where the users can "donate" at least a minimum to keep the service running. 
- If the amount is covered then the rest of the month will be free for everyone. 
- If people keep donating then it will account for next months. 
- A % from all the revenues will go for the creator. 
- The code may be open source, so other developers can contribute with PRs which can lower the fee for the month.
- The community can vote for features
- Visible roadmap for the community to see upcoming features
