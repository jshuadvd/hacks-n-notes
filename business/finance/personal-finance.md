In 1974, the US dollar stopped being tied to the gold value.

Since then, savers became losers. 

We see the DOW Stock industry going up in value through the years. The same with Real Estate. So I thought this was because the Real Estate was always scarcer and the DOW Stock industry reflected more wealthy companies. But if you see the DOW value related to gold, its actually going down through time. 

So 1 dollar from the past buys less. The Real Estate keeps its value related to gold, as well as any other tangible. The difference between food and Real Estate is that food expires. But fresh food keeps its value too. Conclusion, its better so save in assets than in money. 

The more preservable and asset, the more likely it will hold its value through time. 

I think gold is a good option because it doesn't decay so fast as a house would. The house needs maintenance to keep its value. Otherwise the construction becomes worthless and only the land holds value. If the house is rented, the rent money can pay for the maintenance, hence the house keeps its value through time. 



In this case, Bitcoins have the same effect as US dollars since its attached to the market. The advantage of Bitcoins is that they aren't controlled by central banks or governments. Therefor they wouldn't be strictly attached to the US Dollar devaluation. 

 
Net worth is often an estimate based on opinions, not facts. 

Need to invest in what is controllable and has leverage. Stocks and mutual funds are uncontrollable by me. I could control assets I purchase. Leverage with low interest rate loans. 

When buying a luxury liability, has to be from the profit of the assets.

### Whiz kids and supercomputers

> "In the new capitalism, most paper investors are looking for the quick buck, to make a killing. Today, the big investment houses are hiring the smartest whiz kids out of college and using the power of supercomputers and computer models to look for the slightest market patterns they can exploit. For example, if the computer picks up a 1 percent differential, let's say in tech stocks, the investment house will bet millions of dollars, hoping to gain 1 percent on millions of dollars in a few hours. This is very high leverage, and very risky.

> These computer models also cause a lot of the volatility in the markets and often cause crashes. When the stock market announces that program trading has been halted, it is talking about these computer programs' being halted. The markets crash if the computers say *sell*. If the computers say *buy* the markets boom, and then they crash. In other words, *prices can go up or down for no fundamental or business reason at all*. A stock price may have no relationship to the value of the company because the computers created an artificial supply or demand."

Stock shares can give dividend. It's a big gamble to invest in companies just for capital gain. If you invest in stock that gives dividend, then you invest in cash flow too. If the cost per share goes down but the dividend income keeps steady, then the cost for the cashflow is lower and it's a good deal.
