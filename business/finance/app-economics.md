# Apps Economics

Web apps hold a value of building them. Therefor they can be an asset. They also hold portfolio value which can help get a better higher paying job. Apps that are monetized can be like a house on rent. The monetization can pay for the maintenance. But the difference is that the monetization is not limited to one tenant. It can have millions of users. Although its difficult to get single users to pay the amount of a house rent. 

Apps are a controllable investment because you can improve them, maintain them, sell them, or increase advertising. Also the net worth goes up if it becomes popular. It holds its value if you maintain it. It is way more fragile than a piece of land, but can be built from thin air. 

Apps have little tax advantage. I don't know how the ad monetization is taxed.
