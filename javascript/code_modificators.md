# Code Modificators



> [JSCodeShift](https://github.com/facebook/jscodeshift) is a code modificator tool that wraps Recast with a JQuery-like API. Code modificators are scripts that traverse javascript files and can modify it's contents programatically. 
> 
> It works by reading the javascript file text as input to turn it into AST (Abstract Syntax Trees)

An **identifier** to JSCodeShift is like a **selector** to CSS
