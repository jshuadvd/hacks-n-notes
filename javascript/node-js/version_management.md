# Version management

> **semver** is for computers, **release names** are for humans.


In February 19, 2016, React finally announced changing their [versioning scheme](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2016/02/19/new-versioning-scheme.html).


Flexibility to add new *backwards-compatible* features and bug-fixes in **minor releases**. 

Flexibility to support two major versions of a module at the same time.
