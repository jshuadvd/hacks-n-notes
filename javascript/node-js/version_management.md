# Version management

> **semver** is for computers, **release names** are for humans.


In February 19, 2016, React finally announced changing their [versioning scheme](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2016/02/19/new-versioning-scheme.html).


Flexibility to add new *backwards-compatible* features and bug-fixes in **minor releases**. 

Flexibility to support two major versions of a module at the same time.

Minor revision releases should include deprecation warnings and tips for how to upgrade an API or pattern that will be removed or changed in the future.
