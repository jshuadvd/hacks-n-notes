# Intellectual Property





## Ownership

- the one who builds the software is the one who owns it... not the one who pays for it. Unless there is an agreement.

- [ ] does AG/SiteFuel agreement includes the above?
- [ ] what if npm modules have proprietary license?





## Open Source
### Pros
- prototype
- internal tools
- SaaS tools
- use it if will not be distributed

### Cons
- never use AGPL license.. can force you to release all your code to the public

### contracts
- permissive
- weak copyleft: eg BSD (Unix), MIT.. it's mine but you can use it
- strong copyleft: GNU, LGPL remain proprietary, 


## Trade secrets (keep proprietary info confidential)
- like coca cola recipe
- it's cheap
- things like server-side logic.. (to prove has to be FBI )
