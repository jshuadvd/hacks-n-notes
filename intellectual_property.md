# Intellectual Property





## Ownership

- the one who builds the software is the one who owns it... not the one who pays for it. Unless there is an agreement.

- [ ] does AG/SiteFuel agreement includes the above?
- [ ] what if npm modules have proprietary license?





## Trade secrets (keep proprietary info confidential)
- like coca cola recipe
- it's cheap
- things like server-side logic.. (to prove has to be FBI )
