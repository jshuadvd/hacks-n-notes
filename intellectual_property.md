# Intellectual Property


## Stephen Key


- file provisional patent ~ $70
- patents don't protect you that well
- you can license with a provisional patent
- patent attorneys won't work that hard for you as you would.
- keep it pantent pending for the life of the product (since most of the products go in and out so fast now)
- use NDAs
- you can keep re-licensing after a year
- [ ] learn how to make license agreements (it's like a chess game)
- if there's a similar idea patented, you can license it from them.
- your marketing material should sell better than yourself
- most communication goes through LinkedIn
- you need to promote it before building the prototype.
- one minute prototype video is better than sending the prototype (check TV infomercials)
- TV infomercials companies don't care about patents (telebrands, all-stars)
- pitch at least to 20 companies. don't get the big dogs, get the medium dogs that want to become big
- show a lot of confidence
- you can't file again the provisional patent if you made it public
- make a Sell Sheet
- google about a company before showing them your product to see if they have many complaints
