## Ownership

## Copyrights
- just use the C symbol, year, company name + agreements

### Pro

## Open Source
### Pros
- prototype
- internal tools
- SaaS tools
- use it if will not be distributed

### Cons

## Trade secrets (keep proprietary info confidential)
- like coca cola recipe

- things like server-side logic.. (to prove has to be FBI )
