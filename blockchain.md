## Coding techniques

### Random number generation

The method by which random numbers are generated is itself an area of active research; 

- current best-in-class solutions include Bitcoin block headers, verified through [btcrelay](http://btcrelay.org)
- hash-commit-reveal schemes (ie. one party generates a number, publishes its hash to "commit" to the value, and then reveals the value later)
