# Hacks and Notes

The content of this compilation is about my notes on Software Development and other hacks. I mainly write for me, although by making it public I think others can benefit from this work as well.

My [learning road-map](https://github.com/vasco3/hacks-n-notes/issues) describes which are my learning goals and which learning achievements I had. You can see the progress bars on each of the categories. It's most likely that the progress bars will never be 100% full since I'm constantly adding new goals.


## Inspiration

- The GitHub repository notes format inspired by [Alex Cory - fasthacks](https://github.com/alex-cory/fasthacks)
- The GitBook format inspired by [Redux docs](http://redux.js.org/index.html)
