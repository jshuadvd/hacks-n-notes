# Hacks and Notes

My notes on Software Development and other hacks. 

My [learning roadmap](https://github.com/vasco3/hacks-n-notes/issues) describes which are my learning goals and which learning achievements I had. You can see the progress bars on each of the categories. It's most likely that the progress bars will never be 100% full since I'm constantly adding new goals.
