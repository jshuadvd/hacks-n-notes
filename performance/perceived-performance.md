Shoot for 30% speedup.

## Active phase vs Passive phase

> Humans tend to overestimate passive time by 36%

Takes about 1 second to transition to passive state.

Keep users active.

### Wait indicators

| wait time | action |
| :--- | :--- |
| &lt; 1s | nothing |

### Perception Hacks

* fire calls onMouseDown instead of onClick/touchStart \(gains 100-150ms\). Cancel on touchmove
* use `:active` animations. They encourage the user to hold the click longer.
