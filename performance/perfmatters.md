### Regression protection

* perf environment to run automation integration tests (100 times)
* calculate 90th percentile of Pinner Wait Time (PWT)
* binary search (git bisect) to detect which commit introduced the regression

## React

- create a `<LazyLoader />` component 
- with http2 bundling is still optimal
- img sprite for fold images would help
- `<link as="script">`
