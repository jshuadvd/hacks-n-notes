# Databases

Database systems notes.

## Normalization

> Normalization is the process of organizing a Data Object into tables, rows and columns.

There are several levels of normalization.


### First normal form (1NF)

> This is the minimum requirement for a relational database



### Second normal form (2NF)

> If it is 1NF and every non-prime attribute of the table is dependent on the whole of every candidate key.


### Third normal form (3NF)

> Reduces redundancy
