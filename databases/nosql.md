# NoSQL

## Types of NoSQL databases

### key-value

* An associative array
* Single key lookup (very fast)
* Slow to search values
* examples: Redis and CouchDB 

### Column Store

* Orders by columns instead of rows
* Reads faster than Row Store
* Writes slower

### Graph Stores

* stores as edges and vertexes
* eg. social networks

### Multi-Model DB

* combine multiple storage models
* often Graph and something else
